    "# Classification de documents : prise en main des outils\n",
    "\n",
    "Le but de ce TP est de classer des documents textuels... Dans un premier temps, nous allons vérifier le bon fonctionnement des outils sur des données jouets puis appliquer les concepts sur des données réelles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conception de la chaine de traitement\n",
    "Pour rappel, une chaine de traitement de documents classique est composée des étapes suivantes:\n",
    "1. Lecture des données et importation\n",
    "    - Dans le cadre de nos TP, nous faisons l'hypothèse que le corpus tient en mémoire... Si ce n'est pas le cas, il faut alors ajouter des structures de données avec des buffers (*data-reader*), bien plus complexes à mettre en place.\n",
    "    - Le plus grand piège concerne l'encodage des données. Dans le TP... Pas (ou peu) de problème. Dans la vraie vie: il faut faire attention à toujours maitriser les formats d'entrée et de sortie.\n",
    "1. Traitement des données brutes paramétrique. Chaque traitement doit être activable ou desactivable + paramétrable si besoin.\n",
    "    - Enlever les informations *inutiles* : chiffre, ponctuations, majuscules, etc... <BR>\n",
    "    **L'utilité dépend de l'application!**\n",
    "    - Segmenter en mots (=*Tokenization*)\n",
    "    - Elimination des stop-words\n",
    "    - Stemming/lemmatisation (racinisation)\n",
    "    - Byte-pair encoding pour trouver les mots composés (e.g. Sorbonne Université, Ville de Paris, Premier Ministre, etc...)\n",
    "1. Traitement des données numériques\n",
    "    - Normalisation *term-frequency* / binarisation\n",
    "    - Normalisation *inverse document frequency*\n",
    "    - Elimination des mots rares, des mots trop fréquents\n",
    "    - Construction de critère de séparabilité pour éliminer des mots etc...\n",
    "1. Apprentissage d'un classifieur\n",
    "    - Choix du type de classifieur\n",
    "    - Réglage des paramètres du classifieur (régularisation, etc...)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exploitation de la chaine de traitement\n",
    "\n",
    "On appelle cette étape la réalisation d'une campagne d'expériences: c'est le point clé que nous voulons traviller en TAL cette année.\n",
    "1. Il est impossible de tester toutes les combinaisons par rapport aux propositions ci-dessus... Il faut donc en éliminer un certain nombre.\n",
    "    - En discutant avec les experts métiers\n",
    "    - En faisant des tests préliminaires\n",
    "1. Après ce premier filtrage, il faut:\n",
    "    - Choisir une évaluation fiable et pas trop lente (validation croisée, leave-one-out, split apprentissage/test simple)\n",
    "    - Lancer des expériences en grand\n",
    "        - = *grid-search*\n",
    "        - parallèliser sur plusieurs machines\n",
    "        - savoir lancer sur un serveur et se déconnecter\n",
    "1. Collecter et analyser les résultats\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inférence\n",
    "\n",
    "L'inférence est ensuite très classique: la chaine de traitement optimale est apte à traiter de nouveaux documents\n",

      "that is the fact that it was co-written by famed film critic roger ebert , who also was responsible for the screenplay . \n",
      "after watching this movie you will never be able to sit through another one of his reviews where he gives a movie a thumbs down for bad writing with a straight face . \n",

      "i had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening ( it does get explained later ) and as soon as the first scene is over , we cut to a completely unrelated scene . \n",
      "to be honest , as i sat through this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was , i actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the film . \n",
      "with the quality of the writing during the rest of the film , it wouldn't have surprised me if the opening had never been explained . \n",

      "everything from big egos , to booze and drugs to free flowing sex sends them on a downward spiral . \n",

      "ebert had tried to inject as many big words as possible into the dialogue . \n",

      "i don't know , but all the big words in the world wouldn't be able to disguise the bad writing and even worse acting . \n",

      "i've seen home movies directed better than meyer managed with this turkey . \n",

      "i almost got up to check my sound system to see if it was broken , there was such a pile of crap emanating from the speakers . \n",

      "this has got to be the goofiest looking guy that has ever set foot in front of a motion picture camera . \n",

      "and yes , she does loose the shirt a few times and display her impressive talents . \n",
      "sadly , her ass is almost as large as her chest . \n",
      "hey , it a sexist movie , so i'm writing a sexist review . \n",
      "then we have former playboy playmate cynthia myers in a fairly small role as casey , one of the other band members . \n",
      "this goes along with the rest of the idiotic thinking in the movie . \n",
      "meyer casts a gorgeous playmate with a rack to kill for and who obviously has no acting talent at all , but her nude scenes are the biggest disappointment of all . \n",
      "sure russ , now is the time to get artsy and throw in some well placed shadows . \n",
      "on the up side , she does have a fun lesbo scene . \n",
      "i sound like i'm writing a review in a porn magazine . \n",
      "but hey , i'll admit it ; the only reason that i actually managed to sit through this damn movie was to catch a look at cynthia myers naked . \n",
      "and since that was a huge disappointment , i pretty much wasted two hours of my life on this turkey . \n",
      "the only thing that i can say about this movie is that you should stay away from it . \n",
      "unless of course you want to feel good about yourself by knowing that even a pulitzer prize winning film critic like roger ebert has screwed up at least once in his life too . \n",
      "and if you are thinking of checking it out for the double d's -- you are better off just downloading nude cynthia myers pictures off the internet . \n",
      "this is a movie that should be avoided at all costs . \n",
